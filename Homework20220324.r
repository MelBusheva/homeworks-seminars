####1.Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:####
#A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
#A flight is always 10 minutes late.
#A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
#99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it?s 2 hours late.
#Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?####
  
#I saw the solution but I don't think I totally get it

#2.Come up with another approach that will give you####

  count(tailnum, wt = distance)
#alternative
not_cancelled%>%
  group_by(tailnum)%>%
  summarise(sum(distance))

#3. If dep_delay is NA, it means that this flight is cancelled. Subsequently it will not have an arrival time as well.

#6. If it is set to TRUE, it will essentially order the groups by the total number of observations, or, in other words, the rows in the new count 
#column will be arranged in descending order.

#1.Just every operation starts working on a group basis rather than on the whole data.

#2.
by_tailnum <- flights %>%
  mutate( onTime = %>%
  group_by(tailnum)%>%
  filter(rank(desc(dep_delay)) < 10)

#3.What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?

#4.For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

#5.Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the delay of a flight is related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.

#6.Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?
  
#7.Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use that information to rank the carriers.

#8.For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.
